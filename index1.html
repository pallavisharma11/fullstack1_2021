As its name suggests,HTML is a markup language which means you use HTML to simplify "markup" a text doccument with tags that tell a web browser how to structure it to display.Originally HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of doccuments like headings,paragraphs,lists and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.</h2>
